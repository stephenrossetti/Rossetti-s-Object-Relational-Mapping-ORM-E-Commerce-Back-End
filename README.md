# Rossetti-s-Object-Relational-Mapping-ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End, or Module-13's Challenge, is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by taking a working Express.js API and confiuring it to use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. As a manager at an internet retail company, they want their e-commerce back end to have the latest technologies to compete with other companies. This will be achieved by using a functional Express.js API that can conenct to the database using Sequelize by creating an environmnet variable file (database name, MySQL username, and password) to help connect, sourcing a schema and seeds data to create/update the database, syncing the Sequelized models to the MySQL database, and then being able to successfully GET POST, PUT, and DELETE data (JSON format) in the database using Insomnia. This challenge will test our ability to utilize Sequelize, Insomnia, MySQL, databases, and POST/GET/PUT/DELETE functionality at specific API routes.

## Installation

Create new repository and utilize pre-existing code from the Module-13-Challenge (fantastic-umbrella repo). You will need to use and install Express, MySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv (for sensitive data). You will also need to source the schema.sql file to create your database using MySQL shell commands, and npm run seeds to update the database with the seeds data. Finally, you will need to connect to the database, sync with Sequelize, and run the server on local host using the node server.js file.

When the above steps are completed and the challenge's code is updated (for associations, routes and models) you will need to open Insomnia, input the route (e.g., http://localhost:3001/api/tags), and enter POST/PUT/GET/DELETE (CRUD) operations.
